# Realtime NN Classification with OpenVINO

A lightweight neural network classification software built in collaboration with Gary Baugh (Intel Application Engineer), using Intel's OpenVINO software. Allows for GPU- or CPU- load. AI models used include YOLO V3, MobileNet V2, and ResNet 50. Completed as a course requirement for TCD CSU33013 (Software Engineering Group Project), Spring Semester 2023.

Potential applications and use cases that build off of this software include advanced object detection/tracking, human distinction/facial recognition, hazard detection in automotive and industrial applications, etc. The real-time capabilities of the software, when combined with the options offered by the multiple models used and run on a sufficient system, allow for a high drgree of veresatility in potential future use cases.
